/*
 *
 *   - Mathematical set program
 *     This program takes the union, intersection and difference of two sets.
 *     Included are several methods:
 *      - Contains method: checks if element exists in set
 *      - Add method: adds element to set
 *      - Remove method: removes element from set
 *      - isEmpty method: checks if set is empty
 *      - Clear method: clears all elements in set by overwriting with zeros
 *      - Size method: returns size of set
 *      - Union method gathers all elements of two sets
 *      - Intersection method gathers only common elements to two sets
 *      - Difference method gathers all uncommon elements between two sets
